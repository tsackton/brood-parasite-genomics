# Scripts for analysis of Brood Parasite genomes

Repository for code relating to the analysis of brood parasite genomes to look for convergence.

Steps:

1. Whole Genome Alignment using progressiveCactus (details in 01_alignment subdirectory)
2. Extract CNEEs from previous work and analyze using phyloAcc (details in 02_CNEEs subdirectory)
3. Annotate genomes with CAT (details in 03_CAT subdirectory)
4. Some early analysis of protein coding genes

More to come...this is very much a work in progress, code may change without warning.
